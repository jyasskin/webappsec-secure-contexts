<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  As the web platform is extended to enable more useful and powerful
  applications, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the features
  which enable those applications are enabled only in contexts which meet a minimum
  security level. This document describes threat models for feature abuse on the web
  (see [[#threat-models]]) and outlines normative requirements which should be
  incorporated into documents specifying new features (see
  [[#implementation-considerations]]).

  The most obvious of the requirements discussed here is that application code
  with access to sensitive or private data be delivered confidentially over
  authenticated channels that guarantee data integrity. Delivering code securely
  cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and
  privacy requirements, but it is a necessary precondition.

  Less obviously, application code delivered over an authenticated and confidential
  channel isn't enough in and of itself to limit the use of powerful features by
  non-secure contexts. As [[#ancestors]] explains, cooperative frames can be
  abused to bypass otherwise solid restrictions on a feature. The algorithms
  defined below ensure that these bypasses are difficult and user-visible.

  The following examples summarize the normative text which follows:

  <style>
    .secure {
      fill: #8F8;
    }
    .non-secure {
      fill: #F88;
    }
    rect, circle {
      stroke-width: 2;
      stroke: black;
      fill-opacity: 0.75;
    }
    text {
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    text.rejection {
      fill: #F00;
      font-weight: 700;
      font-size: 2em;
    }
    g path {
      stroke-width: 2px;
      stroke: #666;
      fill-opacity: 0;
      stroke-dasharray: 5px, 5px;
    }
  </style>

  <h3 id="examples-top-level">Top-level Documents</h3>
  
  Top-level documents are secure as long as they don't have a non-secure
  <a>opener browsing context</a>. This is a bit convoluted, so let's go straight
  to the examples:

  <div class="example">
    <p><code>http://example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> is not a <a>secure context</a>, as it was not delivered over
    an authenticated and encrypted channel.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://example.com/</text>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p><code>https://example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> is a <a>secure context</a>, as it was delivered over
    an authenticated and encrypted channel.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p>If a secure context opens <code>https://example.com/</code> in a new
    window, that new window will be a secure context, as it is both secure on
    its own merits, and was opened from a secure context:

    <svg width="400" height="400">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://secure.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g transform="translate(10,210)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://another.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g>
        <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 150 287"></path>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p>If a non-secure context opens <code>https://example.com/</code> in a new
    window, then things are more complicated. The new window's status depends on
    how it was opened. If the non-secure context can obtain a reference to the
    secure context, or vice-versa, then the new window is not a secure context.

    This means that the following will both produce non-secure contexts:

    <pre>
      &lt;a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">Link!&lt;/a>

      &lt;script>
        var w = window.open("https://example.com/");
      &lt;/script>
    </pre>

    <svg width="400" height="400">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://non-secure.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g transform="translate(10,210)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://another.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g>
        <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 150 287"></path>
      </g>
    </svg>

    The link can be broken via the <a>`noopener`</a> link relation, meaning
    that the following will both produce secure contexts:

    <pre>
      &lt;a href="https://example.com/" rel="<a>noopener</a>" target="_blank">Link!&lt;/a>

      &lt;script>
        var w = window.open("https://example.com/", "", "<a>noopener</a>");
      &lt;/script>
    </pre>

    <svg width="400" height="400">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://non-secure.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g transform="translate(10,210)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://another.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g>
        <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 150 287"></path>
      </g>
    </svg>

  <h3 id="examples-framed">Framed Documents</h3>

  Framed documents can be <a>secure contexts</a> if they are delivered from
  <a>potentially trustworthy origins</a>, <em>and</em> if they're embedded
  in a <a>secure context</a>. That is:

  <div class="example">
    If <code>https://example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> opens <code>https://sub.example.com/</code> in a frame, then
    both are <a>secure contexts</a>, as both were delivered over
    authenticated and encrypted channels.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://sub.example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> was somehow able to frame
    <code>http://non-secure.example.com/</code> (perhaps the user has
    overridden mixed content checking?), the top-level frame would remain
    secure, but the framed content is not</em> a secure context.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://non-secure.example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    <p>If, on the other hand, <code>https://example.com/</code> is framed
    inside of <code>http://non-secure.example.com/</code>, then it is
    <em>not</em> a secure context, as its ancestor is not delivered over an
    authenticated and encrypted channel.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://non-secure.example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="non-secure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <h3 id="examples-workers">Web Workers</h3>

  Dedicated Workers are similar in nature to framed documents. They're
  <a>secure contexts</a> when they're delivered from <a>potentially
  trustworthy origins</a>, only if their owner is itself a <a>secure
  context</a>:

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> runs <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code>, then
    both the document and the worker are <a>secure contexts</a>.</p>

    <svg width="600" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(400, 110)">
          <circle r="50" class="secure" />
          <text transform="translate(-75, -55)">https://example.com/worker.js</text>
        </g>
        <g>
          <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 405 110"></path>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>http://non-secure.example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> frames <code>https://example.com/</code>, which runs
    <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code>, then neither the framed document
    nor the worker are <a>secure contexts</a>.</p>

        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">

        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <h3 id="examples-shared-workers">Shared Workers</h3>

  Multiple contexts may attach to a Shared Worker. If a <a>secure context</a>
  creates a Shared Worker, then it is a <a>secure context</a>, and may only be
  attached to by other <a>secure contexts</a>. If a non-secure context creates
  a Shared Worker, then it is <em>not</em> a <a>secure context</a>, and may only
  be attached to by other non-secure contexts.

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> runs <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code> as a Shared
    Worker, then both the document and the worker are considered secure
    contexts.</p>

    <h4 id="monkey-patching-shared-workers" class="non-normative">Shared Workers</h4>

    <em>This section is non-normative</em>.

    The {{SharedWorker()}} constructor will throw a `SecurityError` exception if

    <a>secure context</a>, and if a non-secure context attempts to attach to a
    Worker which is a <a>secure context</a>.

    The constructor is modified as follows (though the SharedWorker specification
    remains the normative reference):

    1.  As the first substep of the {{SharedWorker()}} constructor's current step
        6.7 ("If <var>worker global scope</var> is not `null`, then run these
        steps:"), run the following step:

        1.  If the result of executing [[#settings-object]] on the <a>current
            settings object</a> does not match the result of executing the same
            algorithm on <var>worker global scope</var>'s <a>relevant settings
            object</a>, then throw a `SecurityError` exception, and abort
            these steps.

  <h4 id="monkey-patching-global-object">Feature Detection</h4>

  To determine whether a context is capable of making use of features which
  require <a>secure contexts</a>, a simple boolean attribute is added to the
  global object:

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
      readonly attribute boolean isSecureContext;
    };
  </pre>

  <div class="issue">
    {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope}} does not appear to be defined in W3C's

    interpreted as:

  <h3 id="settings-object">
    Is |settings object| a secure context?
  </h3>

  Given an <a>environment settings object</a> (|settings|) this algorithm
  returns "`Secure`" if the object represents a context which the user agent
  obtained via a secure channel, and "`Not Secure`" otherwise.

  1.  Let |global| be |settings|'s
      <a lt="the environment settings object's global object">global object</a>.

  2.  If |global| is a {{WorkerGlobalScope}}, then:

      1.  For each {{Document}} (|document|) in |global|'s list of <a>the
          worker's `Documents`</a>:

          1.  If [[#settings-object]] returns "`Not Secure`" when executed upon
              |document|'s <a>relevant settings object</a>, return "`Not
              Secure`".

  3.  Assert: |global| is a {{Window}}.
  
  4.  If |settings object|'s <a>responsible document</a> has an <a>creator
      browsing context</a> whose <a>creator context security</a> is "`Not
      Secure`", return "`Not Secure`".

      Note: Since we take account of <a>creator browsing contexts</a>'
      status, a popups' status depends on how it is opened, as discussed
      in [[#examples-top-level]].

      ISSUE(w3c/html#524): The 'creator context security' concept landed in
      WHATWG's HTML in <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/1561">whatwg/html#1561</a>,
      but doesn't yet exist in W3C's HTML.

  5.  If |settings object|'s <a>HTTPS state</a> is "`modern`", return
      "`Secure`".

      <div class="note">
        Most of the time, this check will be enough to determine whether
        a particular context was securely delivered. Documents delivered over
        TLS will have their <a>HTTPS state</a> set, and `srcdoc` `Document`s
        inherit their ancestor's <a>HTTPS state</a> (as do other kinds of
        requests which inherit their requestor's origin: see the <a>basic
        fetch</a> algorithm for details on some of these [[FETCH]]).

        We only continue past this check in order to allow resources
        delivered from "trustworthy" but unauthenticated locations like
        `http://127.0.0.1/` to be treated as creating a secure context.
      </div>

  6.  Let |origin| be |settings object|'s <a>origin</a>.

  7.  If |origin| is an <a>opaque origin</a>, set |origin| to the
      <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a> of |settings object|'s <a>creation
      URL</a>.

      Note: We use the origin of the URL here because sandboxed content that
      is treated as being in a unique origin (e.g.
      `<iframe sandbox src="http://127.0.0.1/">`) would otherwise be treated as
      non-trustworthy by [[#is-origin-trustworthy]]. Since sandboxing is a
      strict reduction in the content's capabilities, and therefore in the
      risk it poses, we look at the origin of its URL to determine whether we
      would have considered it trustworthy had it not been sandboxed.

  8.  If the result of executing the [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] algorithm
      on |origin| is <strong>not</strong> "`Potentially Trustworthy`", then
      return "`Not Secure`".

  9.  Return "`Secure`".

  <h3 id="is-origin-trustworthy">
    Is <var>origin</var> potentially trustworthy?
  </h3>

  A <dfn export>potentially trustworthy origin</dfn> is one which a user agent
  can generally trust as delivering data securely.

  This algorithms considers certain hosts, scheme, and origins as potentially
  trustworthy, even though they might not be authenticated and encrypted in the
  traditional sense. In particular, the user agent SHOULD treat `file` URLs and
  as potentially trustworthy. In principle the user agent could treat local
  files as untrustworthy, but, <em>given the information that is available to
  the user agent at runtime</em>, the resources appear to have been transported
  securely from disk to the user agent. Additionally, treating such resources as
  potentially trustworthy is convenient for developers building an application
  before deploying it to the public.

  This developer-friendlyness is not without risk, however. User agents which
  prioritize security over such niceties MAY choose to more strictly assign
  trust in a way which excludes `file`.

  On the other hand, the user agent MAY choose to extend this trust to other,
  vendor-specific URL schemes like `app:` or `chrome-extension:` which it can
  determine <i lang="la">a priori</i> to be trusted (see
  [[#packaged-applications]] for detail).

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|), the following algorithm returns
  "`Potentially Trustworthy`" or "`Not Trustworthy`" as appropriate.

  1.  If |origin| is an <a>opaque origin</a>, return "`Not Trustworthy`".

  2.  Assert: |origin| is a <a>tuple origin</a>.

  3.  If |origin|'s <a for="origin">scheme</a> is either "`https`" or "`wss`",
      return "`Potentially Trustworthy`".

      Note: This is meant to be analog to the <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
      authenticated URL</a> concept in [[MIX]].

      Note: The origin of `blob:` and `filesystem:` URLs is the origin of the
      context in which they were created. Therefore, blobs created in a
      trustworthy origin will themselves be potentially trustworthy. The origin
      of `data:` and `javascript:` URLs, on the other hand, is an <a>opaque
      origin</a>, which will not be considered potentially trustworthy.

  4.  If |origin|'s <a for="origin">host</a> component matches one of the CIDR
      notations `127.0.0.0/8` or `::1/128` [[!RFC4632]], return "`Potentially
      Trustworthy`".

  5.  If |origin|'s <a for="origin">scheme</a> component is `file`, return
      "`Potentially Trustworthy`".

  6.  If |origin|'s <a for="origin">scheme</a> component is one which the user
      agent considers to be authenticated, return "`Potentially Trustworthy`".

      Note: See [[#packaged-applications]] for detail here.

  7.  If |origin| has been configured as a trustworthy origin, return
      "`Potentially Trustworthy`".

      Note: See [[#development-environments]] for detail here.

  8.  Return "`Not Trusted`".

  Note: Neither |origin|'s <a for="origin">domain</a> nor <a for="origin">port</a>
  has any effect on whether or not it is considered to be a <a>secure context</a>.

<section>
  <h2 id="threat-models-risks">
    Threat models and risks
  </h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id="threat-models">Threat Models</h3>

  Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is, in the presence of a
  network attacker, equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin. The
  state of the Internet is such that we must indeed assume that a network
  attacker is present. Generally, network attackers fall into 2 classes:
  passive and active.

  <h4 id="threat-passive">Passive Network Attacker</h4>

  A "Passive Network Attacker" is a party who is able to observe traffic
  flows but who lacks the ability or chooses not to modify traffic at
  the layers which this specification is concerned with.

  Surveillance of networks in this manner "subverts the intent of communicating
  parties without the agreement of these parties" and one "cannot defend against
  the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by other actors no matter
  how benevolent some might consider them to be." [[RFC7258]] Therefore, the
  algorithms defined in this document require mechanisms that provide for the
  privacy of data at the application layer, not simply integrity.

  <h4 id="threat-active">Active Network Attacker</h4>

  An "Active Network Attacker" has all the capabilities of a "Passive Network
  Attacker" and is additionally able to modify, block or replay any data
  transiting the network.  These capabilities are available to potential
  adversaries at many levels of capability, from compromised devices offering
  or simply participating in public wireless networks, to Internet Service
  Providers indirectly introducing security and privacy vulnerabilities while
  manipulating traffic for financial gain ([[VERIZON]] and [[COMCAST]] are
  recent examples), to parties with direct intent to compromise security or
  privacy who are able to target individual users, organizations or even
  entire populations.

  <h3 id="ancestors">Ancestral Risk</h3>

  The [[#settings-object]] algorithm walks through all the ancestors of a
  particular context in order to determine whether or not the context itself is
  secure. Why wouldn't we consider a securely-delivered document in an
  <{iframe}> to be secure, in and of itself?

  The short answer is that this model would enable abuse. Chrome's
  implementation of [[WEBCRYPTOAPI]] was an early experiment in locking APIs to
  secure contexts, and it does not walk through a context's ancestors. The
  assumption was that locking the API to a resouce which was itself delivered
  securely would be enough to ensure secure usage. The result, however, was
  that entities like Netflix built <{iframe}>- and `postMessage()`-based shims
  that exposed the API to non-secure contexts. The restriction was little more
  than a speed-bump, slowing down non-secure access to the API, but completely
  ineffective in preventing such access.

  While the algorithms in this document do not perfectly isolate non-secure
  contexts from <a>secure contexts</a> (as discussed in [[#isolation]]), the
  ancestor checks provide a fairly robust protection for the guarantees of
  authentication, confidentiality, and integrity that such contexts ought to
  ptovide.

  <h3 id="threat-risks">Risks associated with non-secure contexts</h3>

  Certain web platform features that have a distinct impact on a user's
  security or privacy should be available for use only in <a>secure
  contexts</a> in order to defend against the threats above. Features
  available in non-secure contexts risk exposing these capabilities to
  network attackers:

  <ol>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify sensitive data (personally-identifying
      information, credentials, payment instruments, and so on).
      [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]] is an example of an API that handles sensitive
      data.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify input from sensors on a user's device
      (camera, microphone, and GPS being particularly noteworthy, but
      certainly including less obviously dangerous sensors like the
      accelerometer). [[GEOLOCATION-API]] and [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] are
      historical examples of features that use sensor input.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to access information about other devices to which a user has
      access. [[DISCOVERY-API]] and [[WEB-BLUETOOTH]] are good examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to track users using temporary or persistent identifiers,
      including identifiers which reset themselves after some period of time
      (e.g. `window.sessionStorage`), identifiers the user can manually reset
      (e.g. [[ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]], Cookies [[RFC6265]], and [[IndexedDB]]),
      as well as identifying hardware features the user can't easily reset.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some state for an origin which persists across
      browsing sessions. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] is a great example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to manipulate a user agent's native UI in some way which
      removes, obscures, or manipulates details relevant to a user's
      understanding of their context. [[FULLSCREEN]] is a good example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some functionality for which user permission will
      be required.
    </li>
  </ol>

  This list is non-exhaustive, but should give you a feel for the types of
  risks we should consider when writing or implementing specifications.

  Note: While restricting a feature itself to <a>secure contexts</a> is
  critical, we ought not forget that facilities that carry such information
  (such as new network access mechanisms, or other generic functions with access
  to network data) are equally sensitive.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="isolation">Incomplete Isolation</h3>

  The <a>secure context</a> definition in this document does not completely
  isolate a "secure" view on an origin from a "non-secure" view on the same
  origin. Exfiltration will still be possible via increasingly esoteric
  mechanisms such as the contents of `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`,
  `storage` events, `BroadcastChannel`, and others.

  <h3 id="localhost">`localhost`</h3>

  Section 6.3 of [[RFC6761]] lays out the resolution of `localhost.` and
  names falling within `.localhost.` as special, and suggests that local
  resolvers SHOULD/MAY treat them specially. For better or worse, resolvers
  often ignore these suggestions, and will send `localhost` to the network
  for resolution in a number of circumstances. Given that uncertainty, this
  document errs on the conservative side by special-casing `127.0.0.1`, but
  not `localhost`.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  The <a>secure context</a> definition in this document does not in itself have
  any privacy impact. It does, however, enable other features which do have
  interesting privacy implications to lock themselves into contexts which
  ensures that specific guarantees can be made regarding integrity,
  authenticity, and confidentiality.

  From a privacy perspective, specification authors are encouraged to consider
  requiring secure contexts for the features they define.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="packaged-applications">Packaged Applications</h3>

  A user agent that support packaged applications MAY whitelist specific URL
  schemes whose contents are authenticated by the user agent. For example,
  FirefoxOS application resources are referred to by a URL whose
  <a for="URL">scheme</a> component is `app:`. Likewise, Chrome's extensions
  and apps live on `chrome-extension:` schemes. These could reasonably be
  considered trusted origins.

  <h3 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h3>

  In order to support developers who run staging servers on non-loopback hosts,
  the user agent MAY allow users to configure specific sets of origins as
  trustworthy, even though [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] would normally return
  "`Not Trusted`".

  <h3 id="new">Restricting New Features</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When writing a specification for new features, we recommend that authors
  and editors guard sensitive APIs with checks against <a>secure contexts</a>.
  For example, something like the following might be a good approach:

  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the <a>current settings object</a> is <em>not</em> a <a>secure
        context</a>, then:

        <ol>
          <li>
            [<i>insert something appropriate here: perhaps a Promise could be
            rejected with a `SecurityError`, an error callback could be called,
            a permission request denied, etc.</i>].
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  Authors could alternatively ensure that sensitive APIs are only exposed to
  <a>secure contexts</a> by guarding them with the `[SecureContext]` attribute:

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="idl">
      [SecureContext]
      interface SensitiveFeature {
        Promise&lt;double> getTheSecretDouble();
      };

      // Or:

      interface AnotherSensitiveFeature {
        [SecureContext] void doThatPowerfulThing();
      };
    </pre>
  </div>

  <section class="non-normative">
    <h3 id="legacy">Restricting Legacy Features</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    The list above clearly includes some existing functionality that is currently
    available to the web over non-secure channels. We recommend that such legacy
    functionality be modified to begin requiring a <a>secure context</a> as
    quickly as is reasonably possible [[!W3C-PROCESS]].

    1.  If such a feature is not widely implemented, we recommend that the
        specification be immediately
        <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to include a restriction
        to <a>secure contexts</a>.

    2.  If such a feature is widely implemented, but not yet in wide use, we
        recommend that it be quickly restricted to <a>secure contexts</a> by
        adding a check as described in [[#new]] to existing implementations, and
        <a lt="modify a specification">modifying the specification</a>
        accordingly.

    3.  If such a feature is in wide use, we recommend that the existing
        functionality be deprecated; the specification should be
        <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to note that it does not
        conform to the restrictions outlined in this document, and a plan should
        be developed to both offer a conformant version of the feature and to
        migrate existing users into that new version.

    <h4 id="legacy-example">Example: Geolocation</h4>

    The [[GEOLOCATION-API]] is a good concrete example of such a feature; it is
    widely implemented and used on a large number of non-secure sites. A reasonable
    path forward might look like this:

    1.  <a lt="modify a specification">Modify</a> the specification to include
        checks against <a>secure context</a> before executing the algorithms for
        {{getCurrentPosition()}} and {{watchPosition()}}.

        If the <a>current settings object</a> is not a <a>secure context</a>,
        then the algorithm should be aborted, and the `errorCallback`
        invoked with a `code` of `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

    2.  The user agent should announce clear intentions to disable the API for
        non-secure contexts on a specific date, and warn developers accordingly
        (via console messages, for example).

    3.  Leading up to the flag day, the user agent should announce a deprecation
        schedule to ensure both that site authors recognize the need to modify
        their code before it simply stops working altogether, and to protect
        users in the meantime. Such a plan might include any or all of:

        1.  Disallowing persistent permission grants to non-secure origins

        2.  Coarsening the accuracy of the API for non-secure origins (perhaps
            consistently returning city-level data rather than high-accuracy
            data)

            3.  UI modifications to inform users and site authors of the risk
